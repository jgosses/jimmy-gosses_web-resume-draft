                    I'm an aspiring web developer from Baltimore, MD.  I have a soft spot for local businesses, pour over coffee, and driving stick shift.  The goal of this website is to help you understand who I am as a person, what I am capable of as a developer, and how I can be an asset to your organization.  Below you will find some writing samples related to what I'm working on or what's on my mind, and on the subsequent pages of the website you will find a more in-depth bio, my online resume, and some examples of my work. Welcome!</p>

I initially started building the site while still taking the front end web development class, and quickly realized that I didn't yet possess the skills to create a site that I could be proud of.  I still have tons to learn, but I finally feel that i'm to the point that I can execute an idea from start to finish and complete this endeavor. I will continue to polish and improve the website, but for now, this is it! It has been super fun to build and I've learned something new every time I worked on it. On to the next!</p>
