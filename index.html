                        I am a recent graduate from the Betamore Academy Front End Web Development course.  Seeking a career change, I chose web development because I enjoy chasing down problems and creating solutions, meeting strict deadlines, and embracing new technology. I went into the class without prior coding experience, and am now building a simple car club website among other skills-based projects such as a Calculator (Javascript) as well as finalizing my HelloWorld page to fine tune my Flexbox skills.  This class also taught me how to collaborate through GitHub, which will be essential to a collaborative project I will be kicking off soon.  Prior to taking up web development, I have 4+ years of experience in the Medical Device and Healthcare supply chain fields where I have contributed at a high level and become an asset to the teams I have been a part of.
