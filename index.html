                    I'm an aspiring web developer from Baltimore, MD.  I have a soft spot for local businesses, pour over coffee, and driving stick shift.  The goal of this website is to help you understand who I am as a person, what I am capable of as a developer, and how I can be an asset to your organization.  Below you will find some writing samples related to what I'm working on or what's on my mind, and on the subsequent pages of the website you will find a more in-depth bio, my online resume, and some examples of my work. Welcome!</p>

                        <p class="para-spacing">As I continue down the path of web development, one thing I have wanted to complete was my personal website. I initially started building the site while still taking the front end web development class, and quickly realized that I didn't yet possess the skills to create a site that I could be proud of.  I still have tons to learn, but I finally feel that i'm to the point that I can execute an idea from start to finish and complete this endeavor. I will continue to polish and improve the website, but for now, this is it! It has been super fun to build and I've learned something new every time I worked on it. On to the next!</p>

                        <p class="para-spacing">One thing I am learning about web development is that inspiration is everything.  For some it may be the inspiration to get working, but for me it's the inspiration for the design of the site.  If you're working through a site and something just seems off, that's a great time to take a step back and look around for inspiration. I've found that the color schemes and fonts can be two things that make or break a site, and until I find the right one, the site won't look correct.  I seem to hit this realization when a site is about 80% complete. I'll be happy with most of the functionality, excited about how it's coming together, but there's a cohesion that is missing. When I make it to this point, I like to search around for some website inspiration, then jump to a color scheme generator to find a scheme that fits with the goal of the site.  Once this is locked in, the font ties it together.</p>
