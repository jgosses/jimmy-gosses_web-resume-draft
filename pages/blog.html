                    When I was a kid, I used to pour over Car & Driver and Road & Track magazines.  Enamored with the vehicle breakdowns and road trip articles; dreaming of the day I could drive some of these cars myself.  One article that has stuck with me all these years was a journalist’s take on his perfect road.  A premise that could be taken many directions, he explained that in the city he lived there weren’t many great roads to open a car up.  His daily commute was an assortment of boring highways, but he learned to love one particular onramp.  This onramp was explained as having on-camber turns leading into a jersey wall-lined straightaway with enough room to pull the car to heart-pumping speed and back down again before a merge.

                    Drivers license now in hand, I get butterflies at the thought of a properly designed on-ramp.  In high school I only had about a mile of highway on my commute, but the on-ramp was a dream.  Many a times I would merge onto this stretch of road and see a friend of mine up ahead in his Foxbody. In a Mustang myself, I would often chirp third gear on my way up the ramp, see my friend in the distance and work to catch up before the next exit.

                    I compare the feeling of a properly executed on-ramp to emerging to the open air from underwater.  Pushing into third gear and reaching 15 mph higher than one probably should in that short distance is all the rush one needs in life.

                    I recently moved to Baltimore, and have been fortunate enough to have a stellar on-ramp on my evening commute.  In a city without much appreciation for properly paved roads and door-ding avoidance, I somehow worked out an on-ramp with fresh pavement and three on-camber turns leading to a loosely speed-trapped highway.  It’s an exciting enough bit of road to keep my WRX happy and my 93 octane blood pumping.
