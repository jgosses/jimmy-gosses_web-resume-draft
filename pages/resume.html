                <h2>About</h2>
                    <p class="lead-para">
                        Passion is important to me.  After a few years of a job that was unfulfilling, I moved to Baltimore to put myself around people who weren't satisfied with the status quo.  I searched around for something I cared about, something I <strong>wanted</strong> to do every day. My analytical background has shown that I have a knack for problem solving, and after a very positive conversation with an instructor at <a href="www.betamore.com">Betamore</a>, i signed up for a class in Front End Web Development.
                    </p>
                    <p class="lead-para">It didn't take long until i was staying up late into the night chasing down a problem, trying to understand why my simple web page was reacting to a command i had come up with.  It took zero convincing to get me going on a project.  it was at that point that I knew this was the correct field for me.</p>
                <h2>Work Experience</h2>
                    <p>
                        I am a recent graduate from the Betamore Academy Front End Web Development course.  Seeking a career change, I chose web development because I enjoy chasing down problems and creating solutions, meeting strict deadlines, and embracing new technology. I went into the class without prior coding experience, and am now building a simple car club website among other skills-based projects such as a Calculator (Javascript) as well as finalizing my HelloWorld page to fine tune my Flexbox skills.  This class also taught me how to collaborate through GitHub, which will be essential to a collaborative project I will be kicking off soon.  Prior to taking up web development, I have 4+ years of experience in the Medical Device and Healthcare supply chain fields where I have contributed at a high level and become an asset to the teams I have been a part of.
