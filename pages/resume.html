                            <p class="lead-para" id="para-spacing-work">
                                Passion is important to me.  After a few years of a job that was unfulfilling, I moved to Baltimore to put myself around people who weren't satisfied with the status quo.  I searched around for something I cared about, something I <strong>wanted</strong> to do every day. My analytical background has shown that I have a knack for problem solving, and after a very positive conversation with an instructor at <a href="https://www.betamore.com" class="text-link">Betamore,</a> I signed up for a class in Front End Web Development.
                            </p>
                            <p class="lead-para" id="para-spacing-work">It wasn't long before I was staying up late into the night chasing down a problem, trying to understand why my simple web page was reacting to a command I had come up with.  It took zero convincing to get me going on a project.  It was at that point that I knew this was the correct field for me.</p>
                            <p class="lead-para" id="para-spacing-work">I have since relocated to Norfolk, VA and am continuing to pursue this passion.</p>

                <h2>Work Experience</h2>
                    <p class="para-spacing-work">
                        In 2018 I graduated from the Betamore Academy Front End Web Development course.  I chose web development because I enjoy chasing down problems and [ideally] finding solutions. I do great under strict deadlines, and am constantly eager to learn more. But more important than that, I love working on something that matters, and if I can help a company broadcast their stellar real-life image online, <strong>I've won</strong>.
                    </p>
                    <p class="para-spacing-work">
                        I went into the front end class without prior coding experience, and am now building a car club website, have completed my personal website, and am making time to code every single day.  The class taught me how to collaborate through GitHub, which will be essential as I continue to evolve.  The class gave me the foundation I needed to get started in web development; now it's on me to work hard and learn as much as possible.
                    </p>
                    <p class="para-spacing-work">
                        Prior to taking up web development, I have 4+ years of experience in the Medical Device and Healthcare supply chain fields where I have contributed at a high level and become an asset to the teams I have been a part of.
